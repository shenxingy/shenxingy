### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Xingyu (Alex) SHEN! This May, I just graduated from [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/) with a degree in Data Science. I'll be starting my Master of Engineering (MEng) in Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE) at [Duke University Pratt School](https://pratt.duke.edu/) this August.
